# :pizza: Comprehensive Food Database
This repository includes all of the necessary files for a comprehensive database of foods in the United States. 

Included are both grocery store foods and restaurant foods. MySQL files, images for foods, and scripts are also included. The scripts are mainly for scraping the web for images of the foods. The web-scraping involves threaded processing to make it faster.

## UPDATE: 10/16/2023 (mm/dd/yyyy):
Due to Git storage limits, we have decided to move the files for the project onto the file storage platform MEGA. The link to zip files of the database files and images can be found [here](https://github.com/lxaw/ComprehensiveFoodDatabase).

[Here](https://github.com/lxaw/UofSCSWITCHStudy) is an example website using this database. It is relatively simple, but should give a general idea of how the database can be used in a project.

## Database information:

### Menustat:
- 96 Restaurants
- 193,369 food items
- 105,077 image files
### USDA Branded:
- 17,619 Brands

### USDA Non-Branded:

### Menuwithnutrition
- 205,000 foods

#### Note: 
- The discrepancy between the number of foods and the number of images is due to the fact that many foods do not have a particular image for them.
